This program dives in to northeast Airports with a Bar chart, map, and two histograms.
The goal of this project is to show the scale of northeast airport facilities - beyond just the major airports.
This program is a multipage app built in streamlit, and uses matplotlib pyplots,
many pandas dataframes, and seaborn for histograms.
